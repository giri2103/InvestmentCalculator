# InvestmentCalculator

Investment calculator is a simple calculator made using React it can be used for calculating n year capital for a particular sum at a particular rate where n can be any natural number the solely reason for creating this naive project was to apply the new concepts which I learned today in react which are

- single usestate
- lifting state up
- css modules for scoping 
- prop
- state
